# Rest API Testing with Postman

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of requests for API tests using the Postman tool. The focus of this project was to acquire and solidify basic knowledge about API testing while gaining hands-on experience with the Postman platform.

## Test Cases Covered

I executed scripts corresponding to various test cases, covering the following actions:

- Adding three new lists
- Updating the name of one list
- Closing/Archiving a list
- Adding five cards to a list
- Updating the name of one card
- Deleting one card
- Closing/Archiving one card
- Moving one card to another list
- Creating a checklist on one card

## Skills Developed

This task provided an opportunity to develop skills in API testing and efficient use of the Postman tool. By working through these test cases, I gained practical experience in interacting with the API, handling different scenarios, and validating the expected outcomes.

Feel free to explore the Postman collection in this repository to understand the test scenarios and reproduce the tests in your own environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the Postman collection into your Postman workspace.
3. Configure the necessary environment variables or parameters.
4. Run the collection to execute the prepared API tests.

## Conclusion

Engaging in this task has enhanced my understanding of API testing concepts and sharpened my skills in utilizing the features provided by the Postman platform. I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvements.
