## Test Cases for KanbanBoard Web Application

Test cases were designed for the web application [KanbanBoard](http://kanbanboard.pl/) using TestLink.

In my role as a Software Tester at a software house, I undertook the challenge of testing a newly developed KanbanBoard application during its creation stage. 
Despite the absence of the actual application, I had access to specifications provided by the Analyst and mockups. This allowed me to identify potential project errors early on.
As part of the task, I utilized TestLink to create test cases based on the gathered requirements.

Even without the actual application, this proactive approach facilitated the early detection of potential errors. 
This aligns with the principle that finding errors earlier makes their resolution easier and more cost-effective.
HERE: [KanbanBoard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/agakalinowski/KanbanBoard) you can check my test case. Enjoy!
