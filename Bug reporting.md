## Defect Reporting and Management Task

As part of the task, I focused on assimilating and reinforcing knowledge related to defect reporting and gaining experience in using defect management tools, with a particular emphasis on the Mantis platform.

The primary objective was to conduct tests on an e-commerce application and subsequently report identified defects to the Mantis application. The task prioritized the quality of submissions over quantity, assuming that the key skill of a tester is the ability to submit defects accurately and clearly.

Additionally, through this task, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with a sample online store where defects were concealed, providing an excellent opportunity for practicing defect reporting. All identified issues were meticulously reported in the Mantis application, allowing me to enhance my skills in the field of defect management.
